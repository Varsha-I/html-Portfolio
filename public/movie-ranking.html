<h3>Vincenzo</h3>
<p>Oh God I love that main male lead acting, he has such a good interpretation of that character in his way.</p>
<h3>Hotel Del luna</h3>
<p>It has very good cinematography and the way they potrayed the fictional after death world is so beautiful yet sad.</p>
<h3>2521</h3>
<P>This has a very good interpretation of life that suddenly got changed due to uncontrollable circumstances.</P>
